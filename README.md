Hi!

As a Frontend Engineer with 4.5 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in building digital products from scratch and transforming complex systems into scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly solutions used by thousands. My background spans telecom, fintech, and media — industries where performance, reliability, and UX directly impact revenue and user retention.

I’ve worked on migrating legacy platforms to modern stacks (React, Next.js, TypeScript), building UI libraries to unify design systems, and automating deployment workflows to accelerate release cycles and improve engineering efficiency. Whether it's reducing customer service response times, increasing transaction completion rates, or streamlining internal tools — my focus is always on delivering measurable outcomes that support business goals.

Beyond clean code, I bring product thinking and a systems mindset, building frontend solutions that scale with the business.
